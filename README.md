# jwt-node-express

Simple User Authentication API using Node, Express and JWT.

This simple API was built to learn more and get familiar with Node, Express, MongoDB.

**work in progress...**

## TODO

- add admin privileges for updating the database (delete all, update etc.)
- /api/users should only be accessible by admin user
- add more attributes for each user object (random attributes will do, just to explore monk and mongodb more)
- integrate Refresh Tokens to retrieve a new Access Token when expired
- allow users to update password
- allow users to delete their own user object/credentials from the database ('delete account')
